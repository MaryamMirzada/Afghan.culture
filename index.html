            <p>Afghanistan is rich in traditions and customs, and has long been a melting-pot for an array of ethnic groups and cultures.
                 The country is geographically positioned at the meeting point of 4 major cultural areas: the Middle-East,
                 Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Far-East. 
                These different influences can be seen in the cultural norms and practices across the country, 
                and can be tasted in Afghan cuisine, with the country's regional specialities reflecting the variety found across the country
                Hospitality is an integral part of Afghan culture, with the best possible food being served for guests, always following a cup of delicious tea, 
                of course. Tea is drank multiple times every day,
                 is offered to all guests and most families have their own recipe.
                Food is traditionally eaten communally, sat on large colourful cushions called toshak placed around a low table called a sandali. From kebabs and palaw to marinated meats and fruit,
                 a variety of special dishes are prepared throughout the year. Whether during religious celebrations or festivals, or at engagements and weddings, there is always an excuse to eat well.
                It is whilst listening to music when the various linguistic, ethnic and regional cultural traditions of Afghanistan are perhaps the most prominent. Folk music from the southern Pashtun regions,
                 that come in the poetic form of a landay, composed of nine and thirteen-syllable lines, contrast with the Dari four-line chahar baiti form traditionally found in the West. Fused together with western-influences with the foundation of Radio Kabul in 1941, a nation-wide Afghan style of music began to form.
                  It was this era that produced internationally famous Afghan artists such as Ahmad Zahir, and later Farhad Darya.</p>

                     and instability. Despite the conflict, Afghan people tried to preserve their cultural identity. Traditional
                      music, poetry, storytelling, handicrafts, and local clothing remained important in daily life. Although 
                      media access was limited, oral traditions, religious events, and local customs played a key role in 
                      maintaining social connection. This period also saw mass migration to neighboring countries,
                       which helped spread Afghan culture beyond its borders.</p>
